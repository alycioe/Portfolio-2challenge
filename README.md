# Portfolio

# Description

This website is designed to be used as a portfolio that contains all the coding I have compiled over the course of the coding bootcamp. With this fully established, a person could check out my coding ability and decide if I would be a good candidate for a job. It features placeholders that will eventually be a compilation of my best coding efforts, a contact me form, a section about me and another placeholder meant to be an image of me eventually, and links that redirect a user to the part of the site that they would like to browse.

# Usage

The links can redirect a user to the topic they would like to read about, or a simple scroll can bring a user through all the topics. There is a contact category that can be filled out.
